# Legacy Files

This directory contains the original single-file architecture that has been refactored.

## Files

- **generate.py** - Original Python script that embedded HTML/JS/CSS in a single file
- **cartpole.html** - Output from the legacy generate.py script

## Why Archived?

The project has been modernized to use Vite and ES6 modules. The new architecture provides:
- Better code organization
- Faster development with HMR
- Modern build tooling
- Easier maintenance and testing

## Using Legacy Code

The legacy files are preserved for reference only. **Do not use them for new development.**

If you need to revert to the legacy architecture, these files are available here, but we recommend using the modern modular structure in the `src/` directory instead.
